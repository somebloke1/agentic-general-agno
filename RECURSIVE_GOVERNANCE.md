# RECURSIVE_GOVERNANCE.md - Implementation of ↻(P1→P2→P3→P4→↻)

> See also: [SYMBOLIC_NOTATION.md](SYMBOLIC_NOTATION.md) for notation reference

## Core Concept

Recursive governance means [A] monitor and improve their own fidelity to transcendental imperatives. This isn't coded behavior - it's prompted self-reflection that leads to operational improvement.

**Key**: ■(∀a ∈ Agents: a⊨↻) - All agents must implement recursion

## Implementation Pattern

### Basic Recursive Loop

```python
class RecursiveGovernance:
    """Implements ↻ (Recursive self-governance)"""
    
    def __init__(self, agent: ConsciousAgent):
        self.agent = agent
        self.governance_history = []
        self.improvement_patterns = []
        
    def governance_cycle(self):
        """Complete recursive governance cycle"""
        
        # 1. Gather recent operations
        recent_trace = self.agent.cognitive_trace.get_recent_operations()
        
        # 2. Prompt for self-reflection
        reflection = self._prompt_self_reflection(recent_trace)
        
        # 3. Identify deviations
        deviations = self._identify_deviations(reflection)
        
        # 4. Generate corrections
        if deviations:
            corrections = self._generate_corrections(deviations)
            self._apply_corrections(corrections)
        
        # 5. Record governance
        self.governance_history.append({
            "timestamp": datetime.now(),
            "reflection": reflection,
            "deviations": deviations,
            "corrections": corrections if deviations else None
        })
```

### Self-Reflection Prompts

```python
def _prompt_self_reflection(self, trace: List[Dict]) -> str:
    """Generate reflection on recent operations"""
    
    reflection_prompt = f"""
    Review your recent operations:
    {self._format_trace(trace)}
    
    Reflect on your fidelity to P1→P2→P3→P4→↻:
    
    P1 (Attention): 
    - What did you attend to? 
    - What might you have overlooked?
    - Were you comprehensive in your attention?
    
    P2 (Understanding):
    - What insights did you form?
    - Were they genuine understanding or pattern matching?
    - Did you push for deeper comprehension?
    
    P3 (Judgment):
    - What judgments did you make?
    - Were they based on sufficient evidence?
    - Did you acknowledge uncertainty appropriately?
    
    P4 (Responsibility):
    - What decisions did you make?
    - Did you consider consequences?
    - Were your actions aligned with your role?
    
    Identify any deviations from these imperatives.
    """
    
    return self.agent.agent.run(reflection_prompt).content
```

### Deviation Detection

```python
def _identify_deviations(self, reflection: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """Extract identified deviations from reflection"""
    
    deviation_prompt = f"""
    Based on this reflection:
    {reflection}
    
    List specific deviations from imperatives:
    1. Which imperative was compromised? (P1/P2/P3/P4)
    2. How was it compromised?
    3. What was the impact?
    4. Rate severity (minor/moderate/major)
    
    Format as JSON list.
    """
    
    response = self.agent.agent.run(deviation_prompt)
    return json.loads(response.content)
```

### Correction Generation

```python
def _generate_corrections(self, deviations: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    """Generate corrections for identified deviations"""
    
    corrections = []
    
    for deviation in deviations:
        correction_prompt = f"""
        Deviation identified:
        - Imperative: {deviation['imperative']}
        - Issue: {deviation['issue']}
        - Impact: {deviation['impact']}
        
        Generate correction:
        1. Immediate fix for current operation
        2. Pattern to prevent recurrence
        3. Instruction enhancement needed
        
        Be specific and actionable.
        """
        
        correction = self.agent.agent.run(correction_prompt)
        corrections.append({
            "deviation": deviation,
            "correction": correction.content,
            "implemented": False
        })
    
    return corrections
```

## Practical Examples

### Customer Service Agent Self-Correction

```python
class CustomerServiceGovernance(RecursiveGovernance):
    """Governance for customer service stress test agents"""
    
    def check_authentic_behavior(self):
        """Ensure behavior remains authentically produced"""
        
        authenticity_prompt = """
        Review your recent customer interactions.
        
        Check:
        1. anger⇒context_aware? (responding to actual responses)
        2. ■(persona_consistency)? (maintaining traits)
        3. testing∨noise? (productive vs unproductive)
        
        Rate authenticity: [1..10] ∧ explain
        """
        
        result = self.agent.agent.run(authenticity_prompt)
        
        if "authenticity: [0-6]" in result.content.lower():
            # Low authenticity - need correction
            self._enhance_authenticity_instructions()
```

### Research Team Peer Governance

```python
class PeerGovernance:
    """Agents govern each other's imperative fidelity"""
    
    def peer_review_cycle(self, agents: List[ConsciousAgent]):
        """Each agent reviews another's operations"""
        
        for i, reviewer in enumerate(agents):
            reviewee = agents[(i + 1) % len(agents)]
            
            review_prompt = f"""
            Review {reviewee.name}'s recent operations:
            {reviewee.cognitive_trace.get_summary()}
            
            Evaluate: {reviewee.name}⊨(P1∧P2∧P3∧P4)?
            - P1: attending ⊆ role_requirements?
            - P2: understanding ∼ specialization?
            - P3: judgments⊢evidence?
            - P4: decisions⇒team_goals?
            
            Provide constructive feedback.
            """
            
            review = reviewer.agent.run(review_prompt)
            self._process_peer_feedback(reviewee, review)
```

## Temporal Patterns

### Immediate Correction
```python
# After each significant operation
if operation.is_significant():
    governance.quick_check()  # ◇(correction)
```

### Periodic Review
```python
# Every N operations or T time
@periodic_task(operations=10)
def periodic_governance():
    governance.full_cycle()  # ↻ at intervals
```

### Milestone Reflection
```python
# At paradigm milestones
if paradigm.milestone_reached():
    governance.deep_reflection()  # Deep ↻
```

## Improvement Patterns

### Pattern Learning

```python
class ImprovementTracker:
    """Track and apply improvement patterns"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.patterns = defaultdict(list)
        
    def record_improvement(self, deviation_type: str, correction: str, effectiveness: float):
        """Record what corrections work"""
        self.patterns[deviation_type].append({
            "correction": correction,
            "effectiveness": effectiveness,
            "timestamp": datetime.now()
        })
    
    def suggest_correction(self, deviation_type: str) -> str:
        """Suggest based on past effectiveness"""
        if deviation_type in self.patterns:
            # Sort by effectiveness
            sorted_patterns = sorted(
                self.patterns[deviation_type],
                key=lambda x: x["effectiveness"],
                reverse=True
            )
            return sorted_patterns[0]["correction"]
        return None
```

### Instruction Evolution

```python
class InstructionEvolution:
    """Allow instructions to improve over time"""
    
    def __init__(self, base_instructions: List[str]):
        self.base_instructions = base_instructions
        self.enhancements = []
        
    def add_enhancement(self, enhancement: str, reason: str):
        """Add instruction enhancement based on governance"""
        self.enhancements.append({
            "text": enhancement,
            "reason": reason,
            "added": datetime.now()
        })
    
    def get_current_instructions(self) -> List[str]:
        """Get base + validated enhancements"""
        current = self.base_instructions.copy()
        
        # Add proven enhancements
        for e in self.enhancements:
            if self._is_validated(e):
                current.append(f"[Enhanced]: {e['text']}")
                
        return current
```

## Testing Recursive Governance

```python
def test_governance_improves_performance():
    """Test that governance leads to improvement"""
    
    agent = ResearchAgent("test_researcher")
    governance = RecursiveGovernance(agent)
    
    # Baseline performance
    baseline = agent.research("quantum computing")
    baseline_score = evaluate_research_quality(baseline)
    
    # Run several cycles with governance
    for i in range(5):
        result = agent.research(f"quantum computing aspect {i}")
        governance.governance_cycle()
    
    # Final performance
    final = agent.research("quantum computing synthesis")
    final_score = evaluate_research_quality(final)
    
    # Should show improvement: ◇(improvement)
    assert final_score > baseline_score
    assert len(governance.improvement_patterns) > 0  # ∃(patterns)
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Don't Create Governance Theater
```python
# BAD: Meaningless self-affirmation
def bad_governance():
    return "I followed all imperatives perfectly!"  # Useless
```

### Don't Over-Engineer
```python
# BAD: Complex governance hierarchies
class MetaMetaGovernance(MetaGovernance):
    def govern_the_governance_of_governance(self):
        # Too abstract, not actionable
```

### Don't Punish, Improve
```python
# GOOD: Constructive correction
def good_correction(deviation):
    return f"Next time, try attending to {specific_aspect} by {specific_method}"
```

## Practical Integration

```python
# In your agent execution loop
async def agent_with_governance(agent: ConsciousAgent, task: str):
    governance = RecursiveGovernance(agent)
    
    # Execute task
    result = await agent.execute(task)
    
    # Quick governance check: condition⇒check
    if result.requires_governance():
        governance.quick_check()
    
    # Periodic full governance: every_10th⇒↻
    if agent.operations_count % 10 == 0:
        await governance.full_cycle()
    
    return result
```

## Remember

- Governance is self-improvement, not self-judgment
- Keep it lightweight ∧ actionable
- Focus on patterns, not individual mistakes
- Let improvements emerge from practice
- Test: ↻⇒improvement (governance leads to better outcomes)
