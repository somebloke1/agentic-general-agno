# Governance Documentation Update Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the existing governance documentation and provides specific recommendations for updates based on the new requirements:
- Simplified GitHub workflow (no imperative markers in commits)
- Task delegation (orchestrator delegates 80% to Task agents)
- Only 2 approval gates (before first push, before PR to main)
- Mandatory consultation on test failures and architectural decisions

## File Analysis and Recommendations

### 1. CLAUDE.md

**Main Purpose/Content:**
- Master governance document establishing the philosophical framework (Lonergan's transcendental method)
- Defines autonomous development methodology with P1→P2→P3→P4→R cycle
- Links to all supporting documentation

**Required Updates:**

1. **Simplify Human Approval Gates** (Lines 89-112)
   - Reduce from 4 gates to 2:
     ```markdown
     ## Human Approval Gates
     
     You must pause for human approval at:
     
     1. **Before First Push to Repository**
        - Present the core architecture design
        - Demonstrate fundamental abstractions
        - Show test coverage plan
        
     2. **Before Pull Request to Main Branch**
        - Present comprehensive test results
        - Demonstrate paradigm implementations
        - Show performance metrics
     ```

2. **Add Task Delegation Section** (After line 137)
   ```markdown
   ## Task Delegation Strategy
   
   ### Orchestrator Role
   The orchestrator agent should delegate 80% of implementation work:
   - **Orchestrator Responsibilities (20%)**:
     - Architecture decisions
     - Task breakdown and assignment
     - Integration coordination
     - Quality validation
   
   - **Delegated to Task Agents (80%)**:
     - Code implementation
     - Test writing
     - Documentation updates
     - Bug fixes
   
   Use the Task tool for parallel execution:
   ```python
   @task parallel=true
   - Implement agent base class
   - Write unit tests for P1→P2
   - Create paradigm template
   ```
   ```

3. **Update Operational Directives** (Lines 138-143)
   ```markdown
   ## Operational Directives
   
   1. **When uncertain**: Delegate investigation to Task agents
   2. **When blocked**: Apply transcendental method via consultation
   3. **On test failures**: MANDATORY consultation before proceeding
   4. **On architecture decisions**: MANDATORY multi-model consensus
   5. **Always**: Maintain 80/20 orchestration/implementation ratio
   ```

**Symbolic Notation Improvements:**
- Already uses P1→P2→P3→P4→R effectively
- Could add notation for delegation: `O→T[1..n]` (Orchestrator to Task agents)

### 2. GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md

**Main Purpose/Content:**
- Defines Git workflow, branching strategy, commit standards
- PR process with imperative markers
- CI/CD automation

**Required Updates:**

1. **Remove Imperative Markers from Commits** (Lines 60-105)
   ```markdown
   ### Commit Message Format
   
   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <subject>
   
   <body>
   
   <footer>
   ```
   
   ### Examples
   
   ```bash
   # Simple, clear commits without imperative tracking
   git commit -m "feat(agents): Add cognitive trace to base agent
   
   - Implement operation recording
   - Add insight tracking
   - Tests verify both surface and meta behavior
   
   Closes #42"
   
   git commit -m "fix(paradigm/customer): Improve anger escalation logic
   
   - Agent now evaluates repetition before escalating
   - Added test for de-escalation when issue resolved
   - Maintains authentic behavior patterns"
   ```
   
   ### Commit Best Practices
   - Focus on WHAT changed and WHY
   - Skip philosophical markers
   - Keep messages concise and actionable
   ```

2. **Simplify PR Template** (Lines 110-145)
   ```markdown
   ## PR Template
   
   ```markdown
   ## Description
   Brief description of changes.
   
   ## Type of Change
   - [ ] New paradigm
   - [ ] Feature enhancement
   - [ ] Bug fix

   - [ ] No breaking changes
   ```
   ```

3. **Remove Git Hooks for Imperative Checking** (Lines 346-361)
   - Delete the commit-msg hook
   - Update pre-commit to focus on tests and style only

**Symbolic Notation Improvements:**
- Add workflow notation: `[WIP] → [Review] → [Approved] → [Merged]`

### 3. TDD_IMPERATIVES.md

**Main Purpose/Content:**
- Test-driven development methodology
- Two-level test architecture (surface + meta)
- Concrete examples and patterns

**Required Updates:**

1. **Add Task Delegation for Test Writing** (After line 13)
   ```markdown
   ## Delegating Test Development
   
   When stuck or need parallel test coverage:
   
   ```python
   # Orchestrator identifies test needs
   test_requirements = analyze_uncovered_code()
   
   # Delegate to Task agents
   @task parallel=true
   - Write unit tests for agent initialization
   - Create integration tests for P1→P2 flow  
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Implement paradigm validation tests
   
   # Orchestrator validates completeness
   validate_test_coverage(minimum=80%)
   ```
   ```

2. **Add Mandatory Consultation Section** (After line 279)
   ```markdown
   ## Mandatory Consultation on Test Failures
   
   ### When Tests Fail 3+ Times
   
   ```python
   if test_failure_count >= 3:
       # STOP - Mandatory consultation required
       
       @zen-debug model=gemini-pro
       """
       Test failing repeatedly: {test_name}
       
       Failure pattern:
       - Attempt 1: {error_1}
       - Attempt 2: {error_2}  
       - Attempt 3: {error_3}
       
       Code under test: {code_snippet}
       Test code: {test_code}
       
       Need systematic debugging approach.
       """
       
       # Apply consultation results before continuing
   ```
   ```

**Symbolic Notation Improvements:**
- Test lifecycle: `[RED] → [GREEN] → [REFACTOR] → ✓`
- Delegation: `O:identify → T[]:implement → O:validate`

### 4. GEMINI_CONSULTATION.md

**Main Purpose/Content:**
- Multi-model consultation patterns
- When and how to consult other models
- Integration workflows

**Required Updates:**

1. **Make Architecture Consultation Mandatory** (Line 25)
   ```markdown
   ### Mandatory Consultation Triggers
   
   These situations REQUIRE consultation before proceeding:
   
   1. **Architecture Decisions**
      - New paradigm design
      - Major refactoring
      - Integration patterns
      - Performance optimization strategies
   
   2. **Test Failures**
      - After 3 failed attempts
      - When root cause unclear
      - For intermittent failures
   
   3. **Before Pull Request to Main**
      - Architecture review
      - Security assessment
      - Performance validation
   ```

2. **Add Delegation Consultation Pattern** (After line 53)
   ```markdown
   ### Pattern 5: Task Delegation Planning
   
   ```python
   """
   @zen-planner model=o3
   
   Need to implement: {feature_description}
   
   Current code structure: {relevant_files}
   
   Help me break this into parallel tasks for delegation:
   - What can be done independently?
   - What are the dependencies?
   - Optimal task size for 1-2 hour completion?
   
   Target: 80% delegation to Task agents
   """
   ```
   ```

**Symbolic Notation Improvements:**
- Consultation flow: `?→M[gemini,o3,grok]→Σ→!` (Question→Models→Synthesis→Decision)

### 5. QUALITY_GATES.md

**Main Purpose/Content:**
- Automated quality checks
- Code standards and testing requirements
- CI/CD integration

**Required Updates:**

1. **Remove Imperative Compliance Checks** (Lines 52-130)
   ```python
   # Replace imperative checker with architectural validator
   class ArchitectureValidator(ast.NodeVisitor):
       """Validate architectural patterns"""
       
       def check_delegation_ratio(self):
           """Ensure 80/20 orchestration/implementation split"""
           # Count orchestrator vs implementation code
           
       def check_test_coverage(self):
           """Ensure comprehensive test coverage"""
           # Validate both unit and integration tests
   ```

2. **Add Consultation Gate** (After line 425)
   ```markdown
   ## Consultation Gates
   
   ### Required Consultations Log
   
   ```python
   # scripts/check_consultations.py
   """Track mandatory consultations"""
   
   def check_architecture_consultations():
       """Ensure architecture decisions were consulted"""
       
       # Check git history for architecture changes
       # Verify consultation logs exist
       # Validate consensus was reached
       
   def check_test_failure_consultations():
       """Ensure failed tests triggered consultation"""
       
       # Parse test history
       # Find 3+ failure patterns
       # Verify consultation occurred
   ```
   ```

3. **Simplify Git Hooks** (Lines 503-515)
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # .git/hooks/pre-push
   
   # Only essential checks before push
   pytest tests/unit -x -q
   black src/ --check
   
   # Full quality checks happen in CI
   ```

**Symbolic Notation Improvements:**
- Quality flow: `Code → Tests → Style → Coverage → ✓`
- Consultation requirements: `[3xFail]→?→M[]` or `[Arch]→?→M[]`
