# Development Log

## Initial Implementation - Transcendental Agent Framework

### Completed Tasks ✓

1. **Core Agent Implementation**
   - Created `TranscendentalAgent` class that embodies P1→P2→P3→P4→↻
   - Implemented the four transcendental imperatives:
     - P1: Be Attentive (notice relevant data)
     - P2: Be Intelligent (seek understanding)
     - P3: Be Reasonable (judge based on evidence)
     - P4: Be Responsible (act with awareness)
   - Added recursive reflection (↻) capability
   - Cognitive trace visibility for transparency

2. **Agent Lifecycle**
   - Full process cycle implementation
   - State management and reset functionality
   - Interruption handling
   - Parallel execution readiness
   - Quality assessment based on complexity

3. **Message Passing System**
   - Bidirectional communication ([A]⇄[A])
   - Message types: QUERY, REQUEST, RESPONSE, TASK, ERROR, INFO
   - Message routing and broadcasting
   - Cognitive trace preservation per message
   - Direct agent connections

4. **Q&A Paradigm**
   - First paradigm implementation
   - Questioner and answerer agents
   - Follow-up question support
   - Clarification loop for ambiguous queries
   - Learning improvement through cycles

### Test Coverage
- 23 tests passing
- Tests verify both surface behavior and meta-level intelligence
- Coverage includes:
  - Agent consciousness and imperatives
  - Lifecycle methods
  - Message passing
  - Q&A paradigm functionality

### Architecture Highlights
- **Consciousness through prompting**: Agents make cognitive operations visible
- **Two-level architecture**: Surface behavior + meta-level intelligence
- **Paradigm framework**: Reusable team configurations
- **TDD approach**: All features developed test-first

### Next Steps
- Integrate actual LLMs using API keys
- Implement orchestrator for [O]:20%→[A]:80% delegation
- Add more paradigms (debug, medical, trading, etc.)
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Add error handling and edge cases

### Key Files
- `src/agent.py` - Core agent implementation
- `src/message.py` - Message passing infrastructure
- `src/paradigm.py` - Paradigm framework
- `tests/` - Comprehensive test suite

The framework successfully demonstrates that even mock agents can embody transcendental imperatives through proper structure and cognitive trace visibility.
